# runtimesouls

Shared functionality for simple C++ dll mods for fromsoft games, with misc runtime functionality for Elden Ring.

This is not really a coherent library and more of a dumping ground for various runtime mod utilities for personal use.

As a result, **this source code, and any derived source code or object code, may not be used for commercial purposes. You may not use it for mods which require payment to access.** Proper library functionality may be split out and licensed explicitly as needed.

Some submodules are used for helpful library functionality. These are ERSkeletonMan and Pattern16 by Dasaav and mINI by pulzed, licensed under the MIT License, and minhook by TsudaKageyu, licensed under [its license](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

AoBs can be sourced to Dasaav, Nordgaren, LukeYui, thefifthmatt (myself), and others of indeterminate or primeval origin.
